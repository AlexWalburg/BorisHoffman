//TO DO NEXT

//HIGH PRIORITY
//better heat equation evaluation method (Crank-Nicolson?)
//Look through spin transport equations again : add anomalous Hall effect, look at AMR; check everything again; add transmitted spin mixing conductance.
//CG solver for minimization problems
//FFT for Poisson equation (?) - or a better method than SOR, need to research this. Try CG: https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/nedlagte-emner/INF-MAT3350/h07/undervisningsmateriale/chap15slides.pdf

//MID PRIORITY

//LOW PRIORITY

LL with Zhang damping
LL with Baryakhtar damping
