Load trilayer_switch in Boris (drag file to console area, or use loadsim command).

Use run command in the console.

Output in trilayer_switch_mconv.txt

To extract magnetisation dynamics data from individual layers you can run the process.py script after the simulation has finished (need Python 2.7).
Alternatively you can do it manually from the data in trilayer_switch_mconv.txt
